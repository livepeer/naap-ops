# Network Product Team Sync

**Date:** Feb 10, 2026

**Attendees:** Rich O'Grady, Mehrdad Sadeghi, Qiang Han, Speedy Bird Tech, John Mull, Mike Zoop, Josh, Pelina (Marketing Manager)

## Meeting Overview

Rich O'Grady led the meeting to align a cross-functional team on the development of the network product, envisioned as a central hub for developers to interact with the network's capabilities. The foundation is heavily investing in this product as critical to the ecosystem's growth.

## Core Objectives (Epics)

Three main objectives, termed "epics," were defined for the network product team:

1.  **Foundational Metrics and Platform:** Achieve observability and a functional dashboard by the end of February. This epic focuses on leveraging the work of Mike Zoop and Speedy Bird Tech.
2.  **Network MVP Public Launch:** Publicly launch the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the network product, including core plugins, a dashboard, plugin lifecycle management, and integrated observable data.
3.  **Community Plugin Integration:** Integrate and test the first community-built plugins to drive demand on the network.

## Key Discussion Points & Decisions

*   **Network Product Vision:** To serve as a central "shelling point" for developers to access network capabilities such as running gateways, transcoding, and real-time AI. The MVP's core aim is to enable demand on the network. The product must be observable, performant, and user-centric.
*   **Modular Architecture:** The network product will be built using a modular, plug-in-based approach, with the platform potentially acting as an app store for community-developed plugins.
*   **Roles and Responsibilities:** Roles were clarified, with Mike Zoop and Speedy Bird Tech identified as Data Engineers. Josh's significant contribution to the SDK initiative was acknowledged, similar to John Mull's role.
*   **Technical Program Manager Role (Mehrdad Sadeghi):** Responsible for operational oversight, ensuring deliverables are met, and proactively identifying and mitigating blockers.
*   **SDK Development (John Mull & Josh):** Continuous development of the SDK is required to keep pace with evolving features. Quality assurance in CI/CD and operational excellence are crucial.
*   **Plugin Definition Clarity:** A significant portion of the discussion revolved around defining "plugins." Due to the complexity and differing perspectives, a dedicated follow-up meeting was scheduled for Thursday to clarify the definition, value, and technical implementation of plugins. Qiang Han will prepare pre-reading material detailing the plug-in architecture and initial core plugins.
*   **Administrative & Operational Updates:**
*   **Weekly Syncs:** A fixed weekly sync meeting is proposed for Tuesdays at 5:00 p.m. GMT for 30 minutes, starting the following Tuesday. Mehrdad Sadeghi will run these meetings.
*   **Glossary:** Rich O'Grady and Mehrdad Sadeghi will create a public glossary on GitHub to clarify terminology like "plugin."
*   **Communication Channels:** All communications will move from DMs to public channels (Slack/Discord) and GitHub for project updates, milestones, and issues to promote transparency and community integration.
*   **GitHub for Planning:** GitHub will be used for planning and updates, encouraging asynchronous communication.
*   **Process Management:** Mehrdad Sadeghi will coordinate with John Mull to finalize the details for Epic 1, focusing on the next two weeks. Technical specifications and design documents will be shared on GitHub for review.
*   **Next Steps:**
*   Rich O'Grady will schedule a dedicated meeting for Thursday to discuss plugin definitions and prioritization.
*   Weekly sync meetings will commence on Tuesdays at 5:00 p.m. GMT.
*   A glossary will be developed by Rich O'Grady and Mehrdad Sadeghi.
*   Pre-reading material and a list of core plugins will be prepared by Rich O'Grady and Qiang Han for the Thursday meeting.
*   John Mull and the team will continue working on design aspects.
