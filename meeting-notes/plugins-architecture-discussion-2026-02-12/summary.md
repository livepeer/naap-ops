The Network Product Team Sync meeting, initiated by Rich O'Grady, aimed to align a cross-functional team on the development of the network product. The product's vision is to serve as a central access point for developers, enabling them to engage with the network's capabilities.

Three core goals, termed "epics," were introduced:
1.  **Foundational Metrics and Platform:** Achieve observability and a dashboard by the end of February.
2.  **Network MVP Launch:** Publicly launch the Network MVP with core plugins and essential platform functionalities.
3.  **Community Plugins Integration:** Integrate the first community-built plugins into the network product.

Key discussions focused on:
*   **Roles and Responsibilities:** Clarifying individual contributions and team structure.
*   **Network Product Vision:** Emphasizing its role as a central hub for developers, focusing on observability, performance, and user-centricity, aiming to enable demand on the network.
*   **Modular, Plugin-Based Architecture:** The network product is being built with a modular approach, with plans to transition plugin development to the community.
*   **Clarity on Plugins:** Participants, particularly John Mull and Speedy Bird Tech, expressed a need for a clearer definition, value proposition, and technical implementation details of "plugins." This led to the agreement for a dedicated follow-up meeting.
*   **Process and Collaboration:** Moving forward and transitioning to public building practices using GitHub for project management and communication, with a proposed weekly sync meeting on Tuesdays.

A follow-up meeting on Thursday was scheduled to specifically address the definition, architecture, and prioritization of plugins, with Qiang Han tasked to prepare pre-reading material on the plug-in architecture and initial core plugins.
