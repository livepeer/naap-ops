**Rich / Mehrdad - Transcript**

**00:00:00 Mehrdad Sadeghi:** Hey, good, thank you. No, that makes sense. Uh, and I think my February goal is just mostly around network as a product and shipping the stuff, but like we need to clarify the vision and the plan and everything. So, I can actually uh write down that goal. So, yeah, I I saw I saw the document. I saw the TPM role that you put together and makes a lot of sense. Um just one point of feedback that I had and like it goes a little bit different from what you're saying which is like putting it to a like discussion with everyone and here one is that like let's make sure that we use the same process as before like I'm trying to uh kind of bring everyone to use this process of like GitHub and uh do the project management over there. So it would be great if we can do nap there as well because uh throughout this process now Mike and Speedy are using the same process. I feel like Marco is starting to use the same process and then we can get all of the SPEs on this track.

**00:06:09 Mehrdad Sadeghi:** I don't think like changing it right now can help us. Yeah, let me let me just share my screen for a second. Okay. Um so yeah um basically the process is that instead of using linear or notion if everyone all of the SPEs everyone that is working uh on different stuff around the ecosystem use GitHub milestones we have this visual representation of how things are moving forward And the better part of it is that it's very easy to actually get this information out and create week-toeek updates and um monthly updates. So I've documented the process for SPS so they can put together this for themselves and the documentation is available in uh the roadmap.org. In the get involved section, we have the track progress that you can just links back to monthly updates to the retrospective explain the requirements and expectation and how to set up the board and once they do that uh first of all if everyone uses these gith this milestones uh we can automate the process of uh generating updates. and systematically show how people are shipping stuff and yeah that's like the basically the thing that we need and like I I feel uh it can be the thing that brings the whole community together because everyone it I feel like they're using different methods and if they use a single method we can just uh see what is going on everywhere.

**00:09:07 Mehrdad Sadeghi:** Yeah. The way that I see it is that these are different projects. So the pl the plug inside is like one project. It can have a board for itself with different milestones like you have network as a product as like as the product it is and there are milestones to it that we are building and then you have other milestones that are tied to it. So the good thing about GitHub is that since everything is public you can just connect all of these issues together in a different board. So even if like this is a milestone here, this milestone can be a an item inside another milestone and uh like we can make nested uh boards that use the milestones and it's basically an epic as they call it in the like uh management thing. So uh we define the epics and then we connect those epics to the milestones and then the milestones to the tasks and we can see how far along we are over in our epics and then connected to the milestones that we have.

**00:11:17 Mehrdad Sadeghi:** It's better to use something like linear like linear is much better in building those epics. I completely understand that. But I feel like using one system for everyone might be better because if everything if everyone is using GitHub and we have one process for doing everything then we can automate a lot of the work that we are doing. But if we introduced uh linear here and there we have some of the information hidden away and some of it publicly here uh it would be harder for people to uh check it out. Okay. So this one is done. So let's check the other one. Yeah inside the milestone. This is for cloud SP. uh they have like a series of tasks that they are putting together and uh that's basically it like it's it's very simple. Yeah, it's the details and then you have labels and types and like all of that information and the relationships that you can put together. So Mhm. Yeah. Yeah. Exact.

**00:13:43 Mehrdad Sadeghi:** I I understand that. And like we can have three different milestone boards like this one for each of them. Like we have we have one already for the data track. We need another one of this exactly for the uh plugin and another one for CH which is the network product. And then we can start building from this. And I can create the fourth one which sits on top of all of this. And they are already using GitHub like they are com writing the commits. They're writing the issues and uh all they have to do is just uh close the items in their commits. Like again there is integration with this and linear and we can do all of this inside linear but it doesn't have that element of visibility to the point that GitHub has. Yeah. Uh what I can do, I'll try to mock it up. So we already have this one and I also have the explorer one. So I can try to make an umbrella uh one that aggregates all of this.

**00:15:51 Mehrdad Sadeghi:** So we can check if like uh if it's good enough or not. Yeah. So that's that's basically what a milestone is like in the project management definition. You have a exact you have a checkpoint at a specific date that you want to deliver a bunch of work before Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mhm. Yeah. The the bottom one is milestone and the top one is called epic. Epics are big bodies of work and like an epic has multiple milestones inside it. Yeah. Yeah. I just checked with GPT. So epic is large initiative or objective milestone key phases bounded by time and then we have the individual tasks. And I think one thing that like one of my goals for this month can be documenting this stuff like uh we define it once then we can revert back to it because like for example even uh with cloud I sometimes see they use them in a different way like the Mic Um yeah.

**00:20:01 Mehrdad Sadeghi:** Okay. Let me just put a note for myself. So yeah, I I write it and I'll add it to the add it to the road map documents because I've been adding everything regarded to accountability over there. So it's public and This might this might help everyone so they can go back to it. Okay. Um going back to the goal. Um so one goal is like basically documentation and like getting people aligned. And uh the other go. Yeah. Mhm. Yeah. the completion of the first epic which is the like let me see uh what does it have in it because like this is my February goal so like by the end of okay yeah that makes sense Yeah. Okay. Yeah. We can discuss it uh in the meeting in like 3 hours. Mhm. Okay. But like what what do we have right now which is ambiguous like what we have on and we have Yeah.

**00:23:31 Mehrdad Sadeghi:** Mhm. Okay. I'll put it together, but I think you need to sign off on it because you Yeah, like we should be aligned so we can also align with them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Have a channel in project updates and uh yeah, exactly. We already have one for the metrics thing. So, we need two more for I think you need two more for each of the tracks or like work streams and a fourth one for all of it together, you know. Um I think it's like separation. I think it reduces the noise. You know why? Because like when you have like four, you have three silos of work. And if I'm working on the data, I'm not going to care about the other two unless I'm tagged. But like generally I'm not going to care about the other two. And there is the fourth one that everyone should care about because it's like the general. Yeah. Yeah.

**00:27:38 Mehrdad Sadeghi:** I I think we don't need a lot of this stuff right now. Like the immediate need is uh putting asking Sean to instead of wipe coding like put together some milestones and some like issues that like what he wants to do in the next couple of weeks and then create that umbrella uh thing that shows the epics and Um yeah that's uh we already have Gemini so uh we can just turn that on and it also emails the uh yeah the transcript to everyone. Mhm. Yeah, probably like I'm I'm an advocate of using GitHub for everything. Although it's not for like everything because it's public like instead of creating more silos. Let's put like make everything public because it helps us to later like have AI analyze all of this. Yeah, but uh actually for the glossery I've been uh I've been adding all of that to the road map um to the road map document. So like this goes back to what we want to do with road map and like the hypothesisdriven approach like if we want to build like what we can do, we can just uh decommission feature base and take what Hunter gave us add the road map page to it and add all of the stuff that is there and add the hypothesis driven stuff and this way we have like one thing but this is a few steps. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Don't worry about Yeah.
