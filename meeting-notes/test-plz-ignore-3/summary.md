Mehrdad Sadeghi proposed standardizing project management across all work streams, including "network as a product," by utilizing GitHub milestones instead of Linear or Notion to increase visibility, facilitate automation, and create a unified public system. Sadeghi detailed the planned structure for projects, defining an "epic" as a large initiative comprising multiple time-bound "milestones," and committed to documenting these definitions and creating separate GitHub milestone boards for the data track, the plugin, and CH, alongside an umbrella board for aggregation. The plan includes the creation of dedicated communication channels for each track to manage focus, and Sadeghi outlined next steps involving documenting the new process and creating the umbrella epic view, with a goal of maximizing public visibility and completing the first epic in February.

Details:
*   **Standardizing Project Management with GitHub Milestones:** Mehrdad Sadeghi emphasized the need to standardize project management by moving all work streams, including "network as a product" (NaP), to GitHub milestones for visibility and automation, suggesting this approach is already being adopted by Mike, Speedy, and Marco. They explained that using GitHub milestones, rather than Linear or Notion, allows for a visual representation of progress, simplifies generating updates, and serves as a single method to bring the community together. Sadeghi acknowledged that Linear is better for building epics but prefers a unified public system with GitHub to avoid hidden information and facilitate automation.
*   **Defining and Structuring Epics and Milestones:** Mehrdad Sadeghi discussed the structure of projects, explaining that different projects like the "plug inside" and "network as a product" can have their own milestone boards, and GitHub's public nature allows connecting these issues for nested boards or "epics." They defined an "epic" as a large initiative with multiple "milestones"—key phases bounded by time—which contain individual tasks. To align terminology, Sadeghi planned to document these definitions and add them to the roadmap documents.
*   **Implementing Milestone Boards and Communication Channels:** Mehrdad Sadeghi detailed the plan to create separate milestone boards for the data track, the plugin, and CH (the network product), with a fourth, umbrella board to aggregate the others. They noted that team members are already using GitHub for commits and issues, needing only to close items in their commits. Sadeghi also suggested creating multiple communication channels, recommending two more for each track/workstream and a fourth for general project updates, to reduce noise and manage focus across different silos of work.
*   **Next Steps and Documentation Goals:** Mehrdad Sadeghi set a goal for themself to focus on documentation, aligning people with the new process, and completing the first epic in February. They identified the immediate need as asking Sean to create milestones and issues instead of just "wipe coding," and setting up the umbrella epic view. Sadeghi also advocated for maximizing public visibility by using GitHub for everything, noting that this helps with future AI analysis.

Suggested next steps:
*   Mehrdad Sadeghi will try to make an umbrella board that aggregates all of the existing and explorer ones to check if it's good enough.
*   Mehrdad Sadeghi will document the process for epics, milestones, and tasks and add it to the roadmap documents.
*   Mehrdad Sadeghi will put together the first epic for the network product for sign-off.
*   Mehrdad Sadeghi will ask Sean to create some milestones and issues for the next couple of weeks instead of wipe coding.
