# Meeting notes

**Weekly sync:** A [scheduled workflow](../.github/workflows/weekly-meeting-issue.yml) opens an issue every **Monday 9:00 UTC**. It tags contributors to post progress and questions before the meeting; no questions = no air time.

- **Agenda:** Copy [agenda.md](agenda.md) per week (e.g. `agenda-2025-02-17.md`) or keep one running doc.
- Notes and outcomes go in the same file or separate notes; link to the weekly issue.
